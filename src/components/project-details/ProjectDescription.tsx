          We present a campaign with local taste, with "SABOR DE BARRIO"!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300">
          "Sopaipillas pasadas" made with Chancaca Deliciosa, are an icon of Chile's culinary 
          tradition. Our main objective is to strengthen this bond between the brand and 
          people, generating impact and recall.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300">
          To achieve this goal, we carried out a CSR action and outlined a comprehensive 
          communication strategy with the neighborhood as the main ingredient. We went in 
          search of the best "sopaipillas pasadas" preparation, together with the local 
          Municipality. The first place in this contest was won by the skilled hands of Mrs. 
          Ang√©lica, and the prize was the refurbishment of her neighborhood's community 
          center.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300">
          Representatives of the Chancaca Deliciosa brand actively participated in the 
          renovation of this community center, directly benefiting over 2000 neighboring 
          families.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300">
          We amplified this social action with a press strategy in various media outlets, and 
          also executed an efficient plan of investment in digital media with high-impact 
          content. And because sharing is caring... we celebrated the reopening of the 
          community center with a vibrant carnival on Sopaipilla Pasada Day.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed hover:text-gray-800 transition-colors duration-300">
          We had the presence of municipal authorities, and the entire community including in 
          the neighborhood could enjoy activities and surprises. With this campaign, we not 
          only connected the brand with people but also caused a positive impact and made 
          a lasting impression... with authentic "sabor de barrio"!
