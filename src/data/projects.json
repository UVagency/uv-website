Our main objective is to strengthen this bond between the brand and people, generating impact and recall. To achieve this goal, we carried out a CSR action and outlined a comprehensive communication strategy with the neighborhood as the main ingredient. We went in search of the best 'sopaipillas pasadas' preparation, together with the local Municipality. The first place in this contest was won by the skilled hands of Mrs. Angélica, and the prize was the refurbishment of her neighborhood's community center. Representatives of the Chancaca Deliciosa brand actively participated in the renovation of this community center, directly benefiting over 2000 neighboring families. We amplified this social action with a press strategy in various media outlets, and also executed an efficient plan of investment in digital media with high-impact content. And because sharing is caring... we celebrated the reopening of the community center with a vibrant carnival on Sopaipilla Pasada Day. We had the presence of municipal authorities, and the entire community including in the neighborhood could enjoy activities and surprises. With this campaign, we not only connected the brand with people but also caused a positive impact and made a lasting impression... with authentic 'sabor de barrio'!",

The campaign achieved remarkable results, including 115 traditional media mentions, $70,000 in earned media value, and over 5 million digital impressions. Most importantly, we established Krispy Kreme as more than just a doughnut shop – we created a new cultural phenomenon in Chile's food scene.",
