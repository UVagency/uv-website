We invited more than 2,000 people to enjoy the UEFA Champions League final in the best Heineken style.\n\n## Execution\n\nWe carried out a comprehensive campaign that included promotional activation at point of sale and amplification through digital media. We generated the strategy, planning, and purchase of digital media with two clear objectives: awareness and traffic referral to point of sale.\n\n- **Heineken + UEFA Champions League**: Adapting content received from global to local language -with corresponding approvals-\n- **Green Store**: Creating original content locally to communicate the brand's e-commerce\n\nTo participate, people had to enter the hidden code within the packs on our website, sharing their data with the brand.\n\n## Challenge\n\nThe objectives for this campaign were:\n\n- To continue positioning Heineken alongside the UEFA Champions League\n- Increase share of shelf and brand visibility\n- Encourage product purchase through the development of a promotion\n\nFor all fans of the tournament, the ultimate prize is to see the final of the competition in person. We made this a reality not only for the winners but also for their companions."
